🕹️ About the Project

This is a Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It’s a beginner-friendly project designed to improve JavaScript skills and strengthen understanding of the DOM (Document Object Model).

The game allows two players to take turns and compete to win by forming a line of three — either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
